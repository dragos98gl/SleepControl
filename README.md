Sleep Control is a project that combines trough Bluetooth technology two unitary components: the phone and a hardware assembler.
Sleep is divided into several phases, repeating overnight and forming cycles.
Throughout these phases, sleep becomes deeper and deeper, the parameter that the application uses is the pulse. As sleep is deeper, the heartbeat is reduced until sleep reaches REM or Rapid Eye Movement. This phase is the end of a cycle. At this stage, the person's pulse increases and after the cycle is completed, the pulse decreases progressively relative to the sleep phase.
According to the research done for this project if the person is awakened during a cycle, it will be tired and the most desirable moment for waking is immediately after the REM phase.
So Sleep Control studies the user's biological activity during sleep and aims to be fully awake.
